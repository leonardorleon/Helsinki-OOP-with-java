        COURSE FEEDBACK:
        
        I just want to say thank you to everyone that was involved in creating these two courses (Java I and Java II) and also for
        making it available to anyone that wants to learn. It has been an amazing resource and even being able to ask questions
        to very knowledgeable people was amazing. The fact that you can complete the exercises and get some feedback on what might be going wrong
        or why a test is failing is amazing. I was able to go at my own pace and complete the two courses in the time I had available. 
        
        I spent a lot of time and effort working on these courses and I think that I learned a lot. It serves as a good way for me to get into a more 
        programming oriented field. So far I have mainly used programming as a way to perform computations on math or physics problems, but
        I intend to use what I have learned in this course and what I will continue to learn after it as a way to create more complete solutions
        or applications and start a career path in data science. Once again, I think the course was great, while sometimes tests can be a bit rigid or not
        always clear enough on what is failing, it is completely understandable and I don't think it gets int he way of learning. If any of these
        things became an issue, then asking a question on the chat surely solved it. So no complains, just gratitude!
